#### Machine Learning : SIG-TKMCE
*April 2019*   
I co-taught the basics of machine learning and deep learning to my peers and juniors in the evenings after college lectures. I conducted sessions on the prerequisites needed to start with machine learning -- Statistics, Probability, Linear Algebra and Calculus, Data Visualisation; before starting with simple machine learning methods like Linear Regression. I also gave an overview about the deep learning field and its applications in Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning.
