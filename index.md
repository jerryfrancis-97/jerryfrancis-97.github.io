Hi! I'm Jerome Francis, a recent graduate from TKM College of Engineering,Kollam, currently working in TCS. I'm interested in Deep Learning with a specific interest in Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. 
</div>

I did my undergraduate from TKM College of Engineering, Kollam in Computer Science and Engineering with Honors.

<h3> <i class="fa fa-newspaper-o"></i> Recent news </h3>

What I'm doing now :
* Studying RL papers and implementing projects based on different concepts of RL.
* Reading "Godel,Escher,Bach : An Eternal Golden Braid by Douglas Hofstadter"
* Doing a project on Dynamic Music Visualisation: Interpreting Music with shapes and Colors

<h3> <i class="fa fa-id-card"></i> A bit more about me </h3>

I love reading fiction novels about science, philosophy and a bit of history, for example, the Dan Brown series, cycling early in the morning or in the evening -- which mostly depends on the mood or work, and playing online chess or solving some chess puzzles.

          <!-- <img src='/assets/img/projects/taxi-task.gif' class='project-img' -->
          <p>A tabular version of Q-Learning along with Temporal Difference concept was used to make the taxi agent pickup a passenger from their source and drop them at their given destinations. Gym's taxi-task environment was used here.</p>

      <!-- <img src='/assets/img/projects/taxi-task.gif' class='project-img' -->
      <p>In my final-year research project, I worked on MRI Imaging particularly the IVIM technique, and worked on different ways to improve it. My job in the team was to focus on the Image Segmentation part where, diiferent methods were studied to identify tumor accurately and robustly in the MRI scans.<br>Advisor :: Dr. Ansamma John , HOD (CSE), TKMCE</p>

        <!-- <img src='/assets/img/projects/hydranet.png' class='project-img'> -->
        <p>This is a part of an IoT based smart waste management system using smart bins to provide waste-management services. Its objective is to calculate an estimate amount of waste generated by a locality on a periodical basis (days, weeks). The data was experimented with different time-series models like SARIMA and ARIMA to study about the waste generation. This study was used to ensure the frequency of removing waste from smart bins. The smart waste management system was selected for final round of TEKCON'19 contest. </p>

         <!-- <img src='/assets/img/projects/hydranet.png' class='project-img'> -->
        <p>It uses LSTM network model to learn a jazz composition and then randomly sample musical tones according to the jazz style learned. This was an assignment of week 1for a course "Sequence and Models" in Coursera.</p>

          <!-- <img src='/assets/img/projects/taxi-task.gif' class='project-img' -->
          <p>Developed a feature to measure rail gaps of rail tracks present in video frames using Semantic Segmentation. This measurement is used to detect gaps which exceed a threshold value.Three modes of measurement namely, centre-to-centre mode, outer-rail to outer-rail mode and inner-rail to inner-rail mode of railway tracks. This project was part of my internship done in July 2019.</p>

<strong> August, 2017 </strong> - I've been working on my private pilot license (PPL) this summer at Burlington Executive Airport (CZBA). After two months of training, I finished my first solo flight (which means I was the only person in the aircraft). If you're interested in seeing the whole flight, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE3_-Uywr4U">
