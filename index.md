        <p>
        Hi! I'm Jerome Francis, a recent graduate from TKM College of Engineering,Kollam. I'm interested in Deep Learning with a specific interest in Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning.

      <h3> <i class="fa fa-id-card"></i> A bit more about me </h3>
      I love reading fiction novels about science, philosophy and a bit of history, for example, the Dan Brown series, cycling early in the morning or in the evening -- which mostly depends on the mood or work, and playing online chess or solving some chess puzzles.

          <p>A tabular version of Q-Learning along with Temporal Difference concept was used to make the taxi agent pickup a passenger from their source and drop them at their given destinations. Gym's taxi-task environment was used here.</p>

        <img src='/assets/img/projects/hydranet.png' class='project-img'>
        <p>This is a part of an IoT based smart waste management system using smart bins to provide waste-management services. Its objective is to calculate an estimate amount of waste generated by a locality on a periodical basis (days, weeks). The data was experimented with different time-series models like SARIMA and ARIMA to study about the waste generation. This study was used to ensure the frequency of removing waste from smart bins. The smart waste management system was selected for final round of TEKCON'19 contest. </p>

          Creation of Jazz music using LSTM</a></h4>
         <img src='/assets/img/projects/hydranet.png' class='project-img'>
        <p>It uses LSTM network model to learn a jazz composition and then randomly sample musical tones according to the jazz style learned. This was an assignment of week 1for a course "Sequence and Models" in Coursera.</p>

<strong> August, 2017 </strong> - I've been working on my private pilot license (PPL) this summer at Burlington Executive Airport (CZBA). After two months of training, I finished my first solo flight (which means I was the only person in the aircraft). If you're interested in seeing the whole flight, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE3_-Uywr4U">
